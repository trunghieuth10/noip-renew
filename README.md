# No-IP Renewal

[noip.com](https://www.noip.com/) free hosts expire every month (every 30 days to be exact). This script checks the website to renew the hosts, using Python/Selenium with Chrome headless mode.

Based originally on [noip-renew](https://github.com/loblab/noip-renew) and made some minor improvements.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow  to automatically renew your No-IP hosts

### Prerequisites

- A No-IP account with configured DNS records is required. The method of maintaining IP addresses pointing to these records is outside the scope of this script.
- Your No-IP account must be secured with 2FA/TOTP. This script does not handle one-time codes sent via email.
  - **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on your No-IP account and note the TOTP secret key. When setting up 2FA, you'll be presented with a QR code; the TOTP secret key is displayed below the QR code.**

### Setting up Repository Secrets

1.  Go to your GitHub repository.
2.  Navigate to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.
3.  Click on "New repository secret".
4.  Add the following secrets:

    - `NOIP_USERNAME`: Your No-IP account username.
    - `NOIP_PASSWORD`: Your No-IP account password.
    - `NOIP_TOTP_SECRET`: Your TOTP secret key (obtained above).

To use this workflow, clone the repository and configure the necessary secrets as described above. You may run the No-IP Auto Renew workflow from the Actions tab. Or it will be executed automatically according to the defined schedule.

## Manual Usage (Optional)

This section describes alternative methods for running the script if you're not using GitHub Actions.

### Using Python Script

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the pip lib:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the command:

```shell
python3 noip-renew.py -h
usage: noip DDNS auto renewer [-h] -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -s TOTP_SECRET [-t HTTPS_PROXY] [-d DEBUG]

Renews each of the no-ip DDNS hosts that are below 7 days to expire period

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
  -s TOTP_SECRET, --totp-secret TOTP_SECRET
  -t HTTPS_PROXY, --https-proxy HTTPS_PROXY
  -d DEBUG, --debug DEBUG
```

### Using Docker

You can build image locally:

1. First, build the container image:

```shell
docker build -t noip-renew:latest .
```

2. Then run it:

- Use `-v` to mount the screenshots path into your current directory.

```shell
% docker run -ti --rm -v ${PWD}/screenshots:/app/screenshots noip-renew:latest -u "<YOUR_EMAIL>" -p "<YOUR_PASSWORD>" -s "<YOUR_TOTP_SECRET_KEY>"
```
